# Mini Voyager Interfacing
A set of portable codes that interface with the components found on the Mini-Voyager 1 and 2.
These codes are written for the MSP430G2553 which can be easily connected to the Mini-Voyagers with jumper wires.

## Prerequisites

I've used Code Composer Studio v7.1.0 for compiling these codes.
You would need an MSP430G2553, its Launchpad MSP-EXP430G2/Breadboard, a set of jumper wires and the Mini-Voyager 1 & 2 to run these codes.
These codes can also be used to interface the MSP430G2553 to the stand alone components for which they were written.
