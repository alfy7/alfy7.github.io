# Hello, There!
I'm Alfred, and I am pursuing an Undergraduate Degree in Electrical Engineering.
I've had opportunities to study and work on interesting projects and I have compiled them so that you may also be able to understand and enjoy them as much as I did.  

# Projects
## [Getting Started with the MSP430](https://alfy7.github.io/MSP430-Launchpad-Examples/) 
## [Interfacing the MSP430 with the Mini-Voyager](https://alfy7.github.io/Mini-Voyager-Interfacing/)
